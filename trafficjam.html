    <div class="ui huge header">Traffic Jam</div>
    <p>
      Traffic Jam is a collaborative project I've worked on, our goal was to
      create a map that not only takes you to your destination but it also,
      shows you the current weather conditions on your way to where you wanna
      go, and gives you a music you can listen to while you drive. We used
      Google API, Weather API and a Spofity Playlist widget as assets to help us
      develop this application!

    <h1>The Process/Challenges</h1>
    <p>
      Traffic Jam has a lot of things we wanted to impliment for a
      weather/traffic app. When making it we wanted to make an app that had
      everything a normal traffic app wouldn't have and make it fun an
      interactive for the user. A lot of the challenges we faced were trying to
      figure out how the app would look,function and easy for the user to use. We
      all collectively agreed we wanted to focus on it being mobile and we all
      agreed what cool widgets and things we wanted inside the app. A major
      hurdle we had to over come was really trying to figure out how Google Map
      API worked. It was extremely difficult to get working. We've never used
      anything like this before and we had to have it hard coded to a specific
      destination we wanted. Another challenge was the Weather API. We have
      dealt with API keys before, However, We originally wanted the website to
      be every 5 hours but sadly there was no api that we knew about that was
      able to do that with our skill set at the time. Thankfully, We were able
      to get help and substituted some things for things that worked out better.
