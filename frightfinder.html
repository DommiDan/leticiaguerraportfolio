      <p>
        Fright Finder is a collaborative project I've done with a group of 3
        developers. Our goal was to make an app that finds 9000+ haunted places
        closest to you and Google Maps looks for the location for you and it
        populates an image of where that haunted place would be. This website
        also comes with eerie audio that makes your spine tingle when you open
        the app, with eerie and visuals, hidden foot steps and an abandoned fire
        place.

    <h1>The Process/Challenges</h1>
    <p>
      With this project, We wanted to create a really fun app that was visually
      engaging and interactive. My Job was to do the UX and visuals for the
      project! From the hidden footprints at the bottom of the screen and the
      lighting effect when you open the page. The challenges I personally had
      was trying to make it look scary. Initially, We had so many ideas (Adding
      audio, using a rating system for every place you visit and more
      interactive elements like jump scares.) and things we wanted to add but
      not as much time or information about how to go about it. We had to find
      other things to make out app work, especially since we were using Heroku.
    </p>
    <h1>The Research</h1>
    <p>
      When we created the app we wanted to give it a scary theme, We researched
      scary elements like "haunted abandoned places" and "eerie atmospheres". We
      were also lucky enough to find a 9000+ database that held information
      about haunted places all around the United States which saved us a lot of
      time. We also did a lot of Google Map API research, because we had some experience with
      Google Maps before we came up with the idea of using Google Static Image API to pull the location of the "Haunted Place".
    </p>
    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <p>
      A lot of inspiration came form the game called "The Evil Within" the
      Audio came from "ASMR Thunder, Wind and Rain sounds" as well as other
      haunted creepy elements. They really tied the visuals together.
